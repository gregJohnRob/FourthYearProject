\section*{Progress This Week}
This week I have made progress in making the pass run on an example program using integers. The pass is now able to loop over the instructions of a function, relate annotations to variables and mark variables as equivalent (i.e. if x is equivalent to y, then x and y share an annotation). 

\section*{Aims For Next Week}
By the end of next week I hope to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Clean up the code, to make use of better C++ coding conventions \colorbox{Green}{\color{Black}Easy}
	\item Test the code using more example programs (for example ones using for loops) \colorbox{BurntOrange}{\color{Black}Medium}
	\item Set goals for work over the Christmas period \colorbox{Green}{\color{Black}Easy}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Questions}
I have no questions at the time of writing this report. I will get in contact with
you if I have any.
