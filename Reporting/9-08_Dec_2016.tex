\section*{Progress This Week}
This week I have:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Implemented a handler for phi instructions
	\item Implemented a handler for select instructions
	\item Implemented a handler for shl instructions
	\item Moved functionality for handling how Annotations are stored into a new class
	\item Wrote minor test programs with ``if'', ``if else'' and ``switch'' statements in them
\end{itemize}
This means that I can now handle ``switch'', ``if'', ``if else'' and, to some extent, ``for'' and ``while'' instructions. To improve how the program handles for and while loop instructions, I will have to change a lot so that it is possible for the pass to go back and mark values once it is able to.  

\section*{Aims For Next Week}
Next week I will write the end of semester report. 

\section*{Questions}
At the time of writing this, I have no questions.
