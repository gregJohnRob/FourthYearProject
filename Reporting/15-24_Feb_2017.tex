\section*{Progress This Week}
Unfortunately, this week I was not able to achieve a lot as I was given a large amount of assessments. I was able to get a lot done on these assessments and so I should be able to put them in the background and focus more on the project. Dr Nabi has been extremely helpful in converting the 2D shallow water program to work with TyTra IR. 

\section*{Aims For Tomorrow and Next Week}
Next week I would like to try and finish converting the program which Dr Vanderbauwhede gave me so that it will compile and work with my pass. I would also like to continue to talk with Dr Nabi on converting the 2D shallow water program. Finally, I would like to work on my dissertation. 

\section*{Questions}
There are no questions at the time of writing.
