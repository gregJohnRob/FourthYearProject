\section*{Progress This Week}
This week I started to convert the 2D shallow water test program to work with my pass. In doing so, I have added annotations to the code, and was able to get one file to be fully annotated. This test has given me a much better understanding of the program, and allowed me to find bugs, and misunderstandings throughout my pass which I have fixed in many cases.

\section*{Aims For Next Week}
Next week, I plan to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Continue with my work to convert the 2D shallow water program \colorbox{BurntOrange}{\color{Black}Medium}
	\item Clean my code more, aiming to decrease the number of lines, and improve maintainability \colorbox{BurntOrange}{\color{Black}Medium}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Questions}
At the moment I have no questions.
