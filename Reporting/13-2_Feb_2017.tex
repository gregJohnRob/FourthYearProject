\section*{Progress This Week}
This week I have continued work on my dissertation. As well as working on my dissertation, I found, and worked to solve bugs in my LLVM pass. I have also started to add in warnings (for example, if the pass finds potential overflow errors).

\section*{Aims For Next Week}
I feel that it would be best for me to focus on my dissertation and continue to look for issues next week. I will also attempt to find other programs which I can use for testing my pass. 

\section*{Questions}
While working on my pass, I noticed that it is possible for division by zero errors to occur if someone said that the min/max value something can take is zero. At the moment I simply print a warning message that it is possible for division by zero to occur, however I was wondering if you had better ideas of how to handle it?

With regards to other programs for testing my pass, if you have any which you think would be beneficial to test against, I would be very grateful if you would send them to me.
