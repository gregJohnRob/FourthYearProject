\section*{Progress This Week}
This week I worked on my dissertation, writing early drafts for the implementation and background sections. 

\section*{Aims For Tomorrow and Next Week}
I would like to go over a run through of the program with Dr Waqar tomorrow, showing him what would need to be done in order for the program to be converted so that it may be used by my pass. Following this, I would like to start to convert the 2D Shallow Water program into TyTra-IR from LLVM-IR, using the annotations given to the program from my code. As with last week, I would also like to do more work on my dissertation. 

\section*{Questions}
There are no questions at the time of writing.
