\section*{Progress This Week}
This week I cleaned up the code base to make better use of the coding standards of llvm \cite{standards}. I also wrote test programs for loops as well as accessing arrays. The pass is now able to handle accessing arrays, however loops are proving to be more challenging. Loops create their own internal variables which do not rely on higher level variables.
