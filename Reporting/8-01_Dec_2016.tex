\section*{Progress This Week}
This week I cleaned up the code base to make better use of the coding standards of llvm \cite{standards}. I also wrote test programs for loops as well as accessing arrays. The pass is now able to handle accessing arrays, however loops are currently not handled as they offer a more difficult challenge than originally anticipated.
