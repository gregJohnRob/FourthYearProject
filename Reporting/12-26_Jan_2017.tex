\section*{Progress This Week}
This week I have finished converting the 2D shallow water test program so that it might make use of my pass, and cleaned up my code base by moving functionality and reducing the number of lines by moving duplicate code into functions. 

\section*{Aims For Next Week}
After my talk today with Dr Nabi, I plan to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Add warning messages during compilation when annotations conflict \colorbox{Green}{\color{Black}Easy}
	\item Add warning messages during compilation when annotation limits go beyond the limits set by the type of the variable \colorbox{Green}{\color{Black}Easy}
	\item Continue working on the dissertation \colorbox{Green}{\color{Black}Easy}
\end{itemize}
