\section*{Progress This Week}
So far this week I have:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Created a git repository at: https://github.com/gregJohnRob/FourthYearProject
	\item Managed to convert the Function Pass version of my code to a Module Pass thanks to: \cite{ModulePassError}
	\item Created code to get all of the annotations in a program with help from \cite{getAnnotations}
	\item Finished setting up the reporting system for now
	\item Decided to use \_\_attribute\_\_((annotate(``''))) for getting the annotations from high level C to the IR
\end{itemize}

\section*{Aims For Next Week}
I feel that it would be best to discuss with you what you think the best move would be. However I believe that I should:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Look into how LLVM constructs the individual instructions \colorbox{Green}{\color{Black}Easy}
	\item How to extract information from individual instructions \colorbox{Green}{\color{Black}Easy}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Questions}
I do not have any questions for you at the moment. However, I will try to think of some for tomorrow.
