\section*{Progress This Week}
This week I set up my dissertation on ShareLaTeX and started to write the introduction and background for the project. I re-read the papers that I was sent, as well as look at some other papers which gave some background to heterogeneous computing which I think would be a worth while inclusion in the introduction of my dissertation. 

\section*{Aims For Next Week}
Next week I plan on splitting my time between coding and research. So far I have the basics of the pass working. By the end of next week I hope to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Examin an example program which this pass could be used on\colorbox{Green}{\color{Black}Easy}
	\item Get the pass working for integer types\colorbox{Red}{\color{Black}Hard}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Questions}
I have no questions at the time of writing this report. I will get in contact with you if I have any.
