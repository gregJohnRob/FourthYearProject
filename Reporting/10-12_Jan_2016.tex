\section*{Progress Over Break}
Over the course of the winter break, I rewrote the codebase so that it might be able to handle phi instructions better. In the original implementation of the codebase, the instructions were handled in order and there was no form of backtracking. This meant that any instruction which relied on a later instruction would not be processed properly. In the updated version of the codebase, the instructions which depend on different values are marked. 

\section*{Aims For Next Week And Hackathon}
Next week and over the hackathon, I plan to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ensure that all of the current instructions are properly marked with correct ranges and precisions. \colorbox{BurntOrange}{\color{Black}Medium}
	\item Consider other instructions to be added and add functionality to handle them \colorbox{BurntOrange}{\color{Black}Medium}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Questions}
There are no questions at this time.
