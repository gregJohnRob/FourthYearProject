\section*{Progress Over Break}
Over the course of the winter break, I rewrote the codebase so that it would be able to better handle phi instructions. Due to how LLVM creates certain constructs, for example `for loops', the original implementation was unable to handle them. This is because it is possible for some instructions (namely `phi' instructions), to rely on values which appear later in the program. 

The rewritten codebase is better able to handle this. In this version, when an instruction has a dependency which is not yet known, it is marked so that when that dependency becomes known, the Pass will go back to that instruction and annotate it. 

\section*{Aims For Next Week And Hackathon}
Next week and over the hackathon, I plan to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ensure that all of the current instructions are properly marked with correct ranges and precisions \colorbox{BurntOrange}{\color{Black}Medium}
	\item Consider other instructions to be added and add functionality to handle them \colorbox{BurntOrange}{\color{Black}Medium}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Questions}
There are no questions at this time.
