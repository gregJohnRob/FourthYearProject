Local annotations:
    - When you annotate a variable inside a function, a new function is created
      which grabs a non-global annotation and a call to this function is placed
      in place of a local annotation.
    - When you have a local annotation, the function call can be placed AFTER
      the variable is first initialised. Should it then be the case that the
      Pass will go back and add metadata to the initialisation or simply ignore
      them?
