Questions:
    1. How can you work out the range and precision of a floating point number, given the size of the mantissa and exponent?
        2 to the power exponent
    2. I changed a division by zero to simply be division by 1, is this okay, or would it be better to leave it as it was before (i.e. inf and nan)
       instead of 1, use smallest number in that precision
